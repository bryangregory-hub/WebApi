# Fate GO

My website would encompass and display all fate grand order characters and cards by displaying important stats and function.

## Design Process

The website is made for fate fans who want to have a indepth look in detail for character and cards by displaying all the stats of each fate card

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
-As a viewer, i want to have a simplified soruce to look at everything fate, so that as a viewer i have a place to comeback to as refrence.
-As a designer, i wanted to make the website simple to use and appealing, so that it would be more eye catching.
-As a developer, i wanted to make a website that is simple to navigate and consist with infomation, so that it could attract more users to visit.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.
