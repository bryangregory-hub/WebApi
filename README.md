# Fate GO

My website would encompass and display all fate grand order characters and cards by displaying important stats and function.

## Design Process

The website is made for fate fans who want to have a indepth look in detail for character and cards by displaying all the stats of each fate card

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
-As a viewer, i want to have a simplified soruce to look at everything fate, so that as a viewer i have a place to comeback to as refrence.
-As a designer, i wanted to make the website simple to use and appealing, so that it would be more eye catching.
-As a developer, i wanted to make a website that is simple to navigate and consist with infomation, so that it could attract more users to visit.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - a button displays all the servants in fate go.
- Feature 2 - a button displays all the craft essence in fate go.
- Feature 3 - a button reset the page.
- Feature 4 - the page has a comment section.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:
### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea a search to make sorting out characters and cards easier.
- Another feature idea a sorting button that would sort each card accoring to rarity, damage and health .etc

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
